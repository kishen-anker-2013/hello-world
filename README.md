# hello-world
It is my first attempt in learning more about coding and the coding world! I am excited to start on this journey! :)
This would be my inaugural step towards learning more about coding/Big Data/Analytics and so on.

I would like to give all those newbie coders to chin up and dust yourself off when there are setbacks! This skill would be pave the way for the future and you would be equipped and perhaps already mastered the skill to code! 

Cheers!
